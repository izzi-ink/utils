# Badger Utils

The first set of utilities, [digitize-batch](https://github.com/izzi-ink/utils/tree/main/digitize-batch) convert hand-written notes to markdown files, and then combine them into a single file. 
I use scanning apps, to scan my handwritten notes, and then use OCR sofrware to convert the scanned images to text files. The scripts in this collection are used to convert the text files to markdown files, and then combine them into a single file.

Feel free to use and improve. I will be happy to accept any pull requests.
